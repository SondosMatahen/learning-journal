In this part of reading we learnt about Js many things like:
* how to link JS with html.
* use Js to make web page more intractive ( macke actions).
* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
* The HTML script element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
* If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created. 
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
