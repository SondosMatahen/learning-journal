you should know the result have to be type boolean (true or false)

## Loops:
there are three type of loops but we will dicuss just two.
* first one is For loop:
   if we need to run code specfic number of times we use for loop , in for loop the condition is usually countar which is used to tell how many times the loop should run. <br>

* Second type is While loop:
   if we don't know how many times the code should run , we use while loop. the condition can be something other the counter.
