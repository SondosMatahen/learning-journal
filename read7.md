## Introduction
Java Script , encompasses many of the traditional rules of programming. <br/>
It can make the web page feel interactive by responding to what the user does.
* scripts are made up of instrictions a computer can follow step by step.
* A browser may use diffrent parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page.
* Vocabulary: The words that computers
understand
* Syntax: How you put those words together to
create instructions computers can follow.
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions. 
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

## Expressions
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. <br/>
var color = 'beige'; 
<br/> 
1 EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
2 EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE<br/>
var area = 3 * 2;

# Functions & Methodes
 
 * Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
