A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

### Three reminders to myself of how to keep myself in a growth mindset:
 * _Don't give up until success._
 * _View challenges as opportunities._
 * _It's never too late to learn._
 
 <br/>
### Notes:
 * NOTHING IS **IMPOSSIBLE**
 * TO SUCCEED, YOU MUST FIRST BEGIN.
