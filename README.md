 ### 3 reminders to myself of how to keep myself in a growth mindset:
 * _Don't give up unitl success._
 * _View challenges as opportunities._
 * _It's never too late to learn._
 
 <br/>
 ### **Notes:**
 * NOTHING IS **IMPOSSIBLE**
 * TO SUCCEED, YOU MUST FIRST BEGIN.
 <br/>
 ## Happiness depends on your mindset and attitude.
